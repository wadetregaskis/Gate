public import Foundation // For NSRecursiveLock.  TODO: remove this dependency on Foundation (extract the `NSRecursiveLock` implementation into a standalone package?).  TODO: make this `@usableFromInline internal` once `@usableFromInline` is correctly supported.  https://forums.swift.org/t/usablefrominline-not-supported-on-imports-in-swift-6/72379/2

/// Controls execution of async task(s) like a gate that can be opened or closed, with tasks having to wait to enter while it's closed.
///
/// The gate may be opened and closed by any code, sync or async.  However, only async code may enter the gate, by calling `await gate.enter()`.
///
/// There is no limit to how many tasks may be waiting for the gate to open.
///
/// It is a fatal error (i.e. your program crashes!) to deinit the gate while it is closed and tasks are waiting to enter it.  Either ensure that no tasks are waiting to enter the gate when it is deinited, or ensure the gate is open when it is deinited.
///
/// ### Performance
///
/// `Gate` uses traditional recursive mutexes under the covers.  This allows it to be safely used concurrently from multiple threads / tasks / isolation contexts.  That does mean that it blocks if there's contention on the mutex when you try to ``open()``, ``close()``, or ``enter()`` the gate.  However, it is designed to hold the lock only _very_ briefly while updating very simple internal state, so these periods of blocking should generally be very brief, to the point of being entirely insignificant.
///
/// If there is _very_ high _concurrent_ activity on the gate (from multiple threads), the blocking duration can conceivably become noticeable (as time spent inside `Gate` methods).  This is very unlikely outside of pathological uses.
///
/// Note that it will always make forward progress - it is safe to use with Swift Concurrency.
